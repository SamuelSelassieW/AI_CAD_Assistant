# Security Policy

This project is experimental and maintained on a best‑effort basis.
Only the latest release and `main` branch receive security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue with exploit details.
2. Email: YOUR_EMAIL_HERE with:
   - a description of the issue,
   - how to reproduce it,
   - the version / commit you tested.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 7 days and coordinate a fix and disclosure.

## Scope / notes

- This app runs locally and does not expose network services by default.
- Still, untrusted model outputs and untrusted input files should be treated carefully.
