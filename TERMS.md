## 2. Not a substitute for engineering judgment

This tool is intended for **prototyping, learning, and exploration**.

It is **not** a substitute for a qualified engineer or a certified CAD /
CAE workflow. All results must be independently reviewed, validated, and,
where relevant, analyzed for safety, manufacturability, and regulatory
